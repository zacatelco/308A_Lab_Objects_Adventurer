# GLAB 308A.2.1: An Object-Oriented Adventure  

## Introduction  
This guided activity walks you through the process of creating a simple adventuring game using object-oriented programming principles. We will start with fundamental concepts and the structure of the game, then progressively refine that structure using classes and other programming patterns.
